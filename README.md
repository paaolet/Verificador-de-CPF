CPF Verifier
The aim of the CPF verification program is to validate and verify a CPF number, based on a specific logic in the set of numbers. This project was developed in a team of three people for the Univap Colleges (CTI Univap - Colégio Técnico Antônio Teixeira Fernandes), as both an individual and group assessment.
